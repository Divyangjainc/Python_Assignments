//.Calculate compound interest
//Suppose you deposit ₹100,000 (P) at an annual rate of 5% (r = 0.05) compounded monthly (n = 12) for 3 years (t = 3).

//Monthly rate = 0.05 / 12 ≈ 0.004167

//Total periods = 12 × 3 = 36

//Future value:

//𝐴 = 100,000 × (1+0.004167)36 ≈ 100,000 × 1.1616 ≈ ₹ 116,160
//A=100,000×(1+0.004167) 36≈100,000×1.1616≈₹116,160
//Interest earned: 116,160 − 100,000 = ₹16,160
